    "Before Nate Silver became famous for his political predictions, one of his most notable accomplishment was developing a robust baseball analysis/prediciton, [PECOTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PECOTA). To this day, FiveThirtyEight still has a great amount of sports predictions on their [website](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-mlb-predictions/games/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Silver's Expereince, Skill, and Previous Sucsess in sports analytics. I want to explore two questions:\n",
    " - Is 538's Sports Predictions more accurate than Sports betting institutions?\n",
    " - If it is more accurate, can a person generate a profit, by levereging 538?\n",
    " \n",
    "To explore these questions, I plan on:\n",
    " - Comparing baseball outcome predictions made by 538 to those implied in Draft Kings moneylines\n",
    " - Calculating and comparing the error rates of 538's and Draft Kings predictions (measured like a logistic regression error)\n",
    " - Looking at the expected outcomes when multiplying 538's probabilitys by Draft King's moneyline payouts\n",
    " - Looking at the short/medium/long term profits (or losses) by betting on games with positive expected outcomes"
